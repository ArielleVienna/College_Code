Lab 08:
Image Classification:

Part 1: 
set image to grayscale, so it only does one band in ENVI
run twice, one with defaults, one with changes 

Part II:
Doing a supervised image classification
load in ROI image - its a polygon area with cells selected, so its basically the training sample
Run twice, one with inputted ROI, another with a different ROI. 

instead of K means, run ISODATA

create legend for the land cover classes.
